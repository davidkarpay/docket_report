   - Upload any image
   - Download all sizes
   - Rename and place them here

2. SIMPLE: Create solid color squares
   - Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, etc.)
   - Create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images
   - Fill with a solid color (blue/purple recommended)
   - Optional: Add a letter "D" or simple gavel symbol
   - Save as PNG files with the names above

3. DESIGN YOUR OWN:
   - Create custom icons representing legal/docket management
   - Common symbols: gavel, scales of justice, document, folder
   - Use colors: Blue, purple, or professional colors
   - Export in the three required sizes

Without these icons, the extension will fail to load in Chrome!
